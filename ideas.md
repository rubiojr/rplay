# Ideas for future development

* Levenshtein distance to figure out if two artist/song/album tags are different or they can be considered the same song
* Analytics: number of mp3, untagged, genres, artists, albums, etc
* Export tagged music as Artist/Album/Song.mp3
* Export all music, tagged and untagged
* Find untagged music
* Find by id3 tag fields
* Find similar songs (by content blobs), i.e. slightly modified songs (presumably updated id3 tags) will be listed
* Curses UI
* GTK UI
* Systray (notification area) player
