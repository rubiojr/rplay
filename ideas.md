# Ideas for future development

* Levenshtein distance to figure out if two artist/song/album tags are different or they can be considered the same song
* Analytics: number of mp3, untagged, genres, artists, albums, etc
* Export tagged music as Artist/Album/Song.mp3
* Export all music, tagged and untagged
* Find untagged music
* Find similar songs (by content blobs), i.e. slightly modified songs (presumably updated id3 tags) will be listed
* Curses UI
* GTK UI
* Systray (notification area) player
* Fetch album cover and display it using something like https://github.com/trashhalo/imgcat
* Research https://github.com/YouROK/SRadio, using GOTK3 y libmpv
* Audio visualizer https://github.com/noriah/catnip
* Research https://github.com/diamondburned/aqours
