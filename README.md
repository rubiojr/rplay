# RPlay

[![CI Status](https://github.com/rubiojr/rplay/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rubiojr/rplay/actions)
[![Go ReportCard](http://goreportcard.com/badge/rubiojr/rplay)](http://goreportcard.com/report/rubiojr/rplay)

A command line MP3 player for your [Restic repository](https://restic.net).

## Features

* Index and play available audio files (flac, mp3, ogg)
* ID3 metadata support
* Search your music collection (filename or ID3 tag)
* Support for indexing multiple Restic repositories
* Random, endless playback
* Optionally fetch missing song metadata (artist, album, etc) from Internet (see [ACOUSTICID.md](docs/ACOUSTICID.md))
* macOS and Linux supported

## Installation

Binaries for Linux are available in [the releases page](https://github.com/rubiojr/rplay/releases/latest).

You'll need to build from source for macOS and other Linux architectures:

```
GO111MODULE=on go get -u github.com/rubiojr/rplay
```

Or clone the repository and run `go build`.

## Usage

### ‚ö†Ô∏è A word of caution

RPlay does not encrypt the index created, meaning that the following information from your Restic repository will be available to those with access to the index:

* MP3 file names and ID3 metadata
* Repository ID
* Repository location

### Indexing your MP3

The first thing we need to do, is to index the repository:

![](docs/images/rplay-index.gif)

Indexing yields some stats while indexing:

```
‚¢ø Taco Tuesday.mp3          üéØ 62 new, 0 skipped, 0 errors, 11 f/s, 0.02 minutes left
```

_file being indexed, indexed files count, already indexed, indexing speed, remaining time_

and when the indexing process finishes:

```
üí• 74 indexed, 0 already present. Took 5 seconds.
```

Worth noting also that RPlay accepts the same repository (the `-r` flag) URIs and backends [Restic does](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html), which means S3, rest-server, Backblaze, etc are all supported.

The indexing process will create an index in a OS specific path:

**Linux**

`~/.local/share/rplay`

**MacOS**

`~/Library/Application Support/rplay`

### Searching our collection

The `search` command will search our indexed files (filename searching only for now):

### Playing our tunes

Once we have indexed our repository, we're ready to play:

The play command also supports playing a specific file:

```
$ rplay -r rest:http://localhost:8000 search "*playa*"
Searching for *playa*...

```

```

### Environment variables

RPlay supports configuring Restic's repository location and credentials via environment variables, so you don't have to type the URI and password all the time:

```
export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8000
export RESTIC_PASSWORD=secret
```

## Roadmap

* Better curses UI
* Flag songs as hidden/unwanted
